"This is my first Yelp review. As is normally the case with first reviews, the customer is either overjoyed or bummed out. This is of the \""""bummed out\""""variety.  I tried A. Sakura tonight for the first time as the location was good and the prices seemed ok, but not THAT much cheaper than their competitors. If they were THAT much cheaper then I would be a LITTLE more okay with the quality. Fact is, for the same money, one could do much much better in Madison. \n\nThe sushi is what I tried and rice is the main problem--FLAVORLESS!  Bland!!  Lacking enough sugars and vinegar to make it even close to what sushi rise should be (I make my own at home btw). And, what flavor there MIGHT have been in my rainbow roll was masked by too much mayonnaise type sauce and eel sauce (which normally isn't even found on a rainbow roll)!  Typical fare, such as tuna rolls and California rolls were also bland, on par with super market sushi. Honestly, if I wanted this quality I should've went to a Target.  Blah!\n\nLook, this is Madison, folks. Muramoto, Takara, etc, all have this place beat by a large margin at similar prices. Step it up A Sakura, or get outta town.  This seems to be a place that I'd find in a small town in rural America, not Madison!"
"Amazing food at a reasonable price. Service was great and it started at the top with great hospitality from the room manager/gm, Chad."
"BLT Burger is the latest eatery addition to the Mirage.  Since this place had so much hype, I was expecting quite a good burger.\n\nI wanted to try one of their best items and  ordered their American Kobe Beef Burger.   Even though I had requested medium-rare, they served it to me well-done.  Huge mistake,  you never want to cook any marbled meats well-done since all the juices will go up in smoke.  Since the only way I could tell it was well-done was by biting into it, my first taste of their burger was terrible.  It actually tasted like I was eating a charcoal brickette.\n\nEven though they offered me to re-fire up a new burger, the damage was already done.  First impressions are everything and this place truly missed the target.  Even their fries were lackluster.\n\nI had high expectations for this place, but they let me down big time.  I really don't know if I am willing to try this place again.\n\n\nDecor: 3 Stars (it was okay)\nService: 2 Stars (indifferent staff)\nAtmosphere: 2 Stars (very noisy)\nFood Quality: 1 Stars (my expectations were dashed)\nQuantity of Food: 3 Stars (standard quantity)\nPrice: 2 Stars (not worth it)\n\nFor a Grand Total of 2 Stars."
"I completely forgot to update and mention that I spent the next day throwing up. On my birthday. Again, what a terrible experience!"
"After a so so first visit I took my wife for a quick lunch. Under pressure to order from a extensive menu, so we felt cheated that we might have ordered a better item. Food did arrive promptly but very average - salad was nothing more than a large bowl of romaine, dressing was pretty tasteless, sandwich was very inferior even to Jayson's.\nValue for money I'd score less than 2 stars. Well below average experience."
